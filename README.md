# AI-Snake-Reinforcement-Learning-with-PyTorch-and-Pygame
AI Snake project, a reinforcement learning endeavor that trains software agents to play the classic Snake game. Reinforcement learning focuses on guiding agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. In simpler terms, it involves teaching an agent to behave effectively by evaluating its performance based on the concept of rewards.

In the context of this project, reinforcement learning teaches our software agent how to navigate the Snake game environment by assessing its performance. The goal is to guide the agent to make decisions that lead to maximizing its cumulative rewards.
